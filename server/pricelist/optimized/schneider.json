The \"Reference\" column contains product model identifiers, and the voltage-specific columns (B7, F7, etc.) appear to indicate product availability or pricing per voltage range. Since these are accessories or compatibility details tied to specific voltage types (e.g., 24V, 110V), and the structure matches product availability per voltage class, the columns are classified accordingly. \"Frame\" and \"AC-1 Rating\" relate to product specifications, \"Power Poles\" to physical configuration, \"Reference\" to product identification, and the voltage-based columns (B7, F7, etc.) to price or availability per voltage type.

The headers indicate contact types and model-specific reference numbers, where \"Reference\" likely points to the product model, and the other columns (B5, F5, etc.) appear to be part of a product line or series (likely internal part numbers). The \"NO\" and \"NC\" columns indicate contact configurations, while the reference and model codes (B5, F5, etc.) likely represent different relay types or configurations. Based on the context and naming (CAE, IEC60947-5-1, CE), this falls under control relays. The \"Reference\" column is clearly a product identifier, while the B5, F5, M5, N5 columns are likely part of a series or product code, possibly indicating different relay types or features. The NO/NC columns indicate contact configuration, which is a key specification for relays. Hence, the reference column is primary, and the others are part of a structured product code system. The \"Reference\" column should be assigned as the primary reference, while the B5, F5, etc., are likely internal or product-specific codes, so they are treated as product specifications or identifiers. Since these are control relays, and the context mentions IEC and CE marking, the category and subcategory align with control relays.",
